# Lessons Playbook

<!-- playbook-state: run-tick=1 cap=20 dormancy-runs=10 apply-recurrences=1 apply-confirmed=3 ticked-work-ids=pe1-20260710-111505 -->

Curated, bounded workflow lessons. Read the Active section at the Commander
context step. Never edit by hand or by LLM: apply structured deltas via
apply_lessons_delta.py, which enforces cap, grounding, and counter rules.

Counter semantics split by scope: for most scopes a confirm is trust
(the lesson held again). For a constellation-scoped lesson it is the
opposite — a recurrence of an unfixed shared-machinery defect, so it
accrues recurrences (debt) and flags recurrence-debt. Pay the debt by
exporting to CONSTELLATION_FEEDBACK and fixing upstream, then retire it;
do not keep confirming it into a permanent workaround.
