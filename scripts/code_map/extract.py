"""Pure-AST statement extractor with its own cross-file name resolution.

Python stdlib only (ast, os, json, hashlib). No SCIP, no type inference beyond
the two cheap rules stated in RESOLUTION RULES below.

Two passes:
  pass 1  index every corpus module's *module-level* binding table
          (defs, classes, assignments, imports and what each import binds)
  pass 2  walk the same files, tracking scopes, and emit one statement per
          fact with the resolved symbol -- or an explicit unresolved marker.

Both passes read the mappable corpus from `discovery.discover_corpus`. The
prototype this was ported from indexed three hardcoded directories of one
external checkout and took its pass-2 file list from a handwritten manifest.

RESOLUTION RULES (the honest cheap version)
  R1 scope chain      a name bound in an enclosing function scope is `local`
  R2 module table     else a module-level def/class/assign -> mod:name
  R3 imports          from m import n [as a] -> a binds (m, n)
                      import m.n [as a]      -> a binds module m.n
                      relative imports resolved from the file's package path
  R4 re-export chase  if m's own table says n is itself an import, follow it
                      (max 5 hops) to the defining module
  R5 attribute base   module alias  -> mod:attr (then R4)
                      class name    -> mod:Class.attr (walk same-module bases)
                      self in C     -> mod:C.attr (walk same-module bases)
                      local var whose ONLY assignment is `v = Known(...)`
                                    -> mod:Known.attr        [inference rule 1]
                      param annotated `p: Known`
                                    -> mod:Known.attr        [inference rule 2]
                      anything else -> UNRESOLVED/dispatch-unknown-base
  R6 star import      from m import * : if m is internal and has the name,
                      resolve; else UNRESOLVED/star-import
  R7 builtins         -> external
  R8 dynamic          getattr/setattr/importlib -> UNRESOLVED/dynamic

Statement line shape:
  {"s","p","o","q":{"file","line","col"},"ref":"ast","hash"}
plus two measurement-only fields:
  "res"  internal|external|local|unresolved|literal
  "why"  failure class, present only when res == unresolved

THE LINE BASE IS DECLARED, NOT IMPLIED (defect D1)
--------------------------------------------------
`q.line` is written in the base named by `LINE_BASE` below, and every file the
extractor reads gets an `extraction-window` statement that says so in the store
itself. Before this the store was 0-based and the schema was silent; the proof
of the silence was the renderer's bare `+1` at the read site, which a reader who
trusted the schema had no way to know he needed. Consumers read the declared
base; they do not add one.

The window statement is also the extractor's own coverage boundary: a file that
failed to parse gets no window, so a reader can tell a fact that is ABSENT FROM
THE CODE from a fact that was never looked at. `q.line` on the window is the
first line of the file in the declared base, so the window itself is not an
exception to the base it declares.

        Gate g7's convention-gap resolution: `sym` is the CALLER's choice, not
        derived here. A whole-function tag (directly above a `def`/`class`)
        is called with the entity's OWN symbol; a tag above a statement
        inside a body is called with `self.here()`, the ENCLOSING entity or
        module -- there is no page finer than one per entity, so that is
        where it renders regardless of which statement it sat above. Same
        decorator-aware two-line check as `anchor()`, for the same reason: a
        reader writes the comment above the first decorator, not the `def`.

        Gate g7 remediation fix 1: `span_node` is the node whose span gets
        HASHED for staleness -- the gate's own rule is "flag when the
        ENCLOSING body changed while the tag text did not", not "when this
        exact statement changed". For a whole-function/class tag `span_node`
        defaults to `node` itself (the entity IS its own enclosing body,
        exactly like `anchor()`); the statement-level call sites
        (`visit_Assign`/`visit_AnnAssign`) pass the enclosing entity/module
