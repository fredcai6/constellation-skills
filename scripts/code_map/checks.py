"""Checks over the built map that CAN FAIL.

`check` exits non-zero when any invariant below is violated. Before gate g1
every function here printed a measurement, asserted nothing, and `run()` ended
in a literal `return 0`, so a completely broken map passed. The measurements are
gone: they were diagnostics wearing a suite's clothes.

What belongs here
-----------------
A **move-invariant** relates two independently-derived facts and holds at any
corpus size: `pages - 1 - modules == entity_pages`, a page's caller list against
a second scan of the store, a page that exists and holds nothing. It survives
every later gate that changes the map's shape, because it never mentions the
shape's numbers.

A **baseline** pins a remembered constant -- "103 modules", "3411 entities", a
page's rendered text, the header format, the section order. It goes red at every
gate that legitimately moves the map, so it would be deleted rather than
believed. Baselines belong to `gB`, after the last gate that moves the numbers.

The distinction is not "does it mention a count". It is: does the expected value
come from a memory of this corpus, or from the map itself?

What these checks read
----------------------
The store DIRECTLY, never through `render.load_stores`, and -- since `g3` --
the SOURCE. A check whose expected value is computed by the code under test can
only ever agree with it, which is not a check. So the store scan below is
written a second time on purpose, the source scan beside it derives definition
names without borrowing a line of the extractor, and both are compared against
the RENDERED PAGES -- the artifact a reader actually gets -- rather than against
the renderer's own in-memory state.

What they do NOT prove is recorded honestly beside each check.

`check` EXITS 1 ON THIS REPO TODAY, and that is correct
------------------------------------------------------
`page_accounting` is red by exactly one page: two entities named `Verdict` and
`verdict` resolve to one filename on a case-insensitive filesystem, so the map
advertises a page it does not have. Gate `g2` owns the rename; `g1` only asserts
it. Do not silence the check to make the command green.

      loss that coverage cannot: a page duplicated, or a page in the tree the
      store never asked for.

    Coverage is asserted on its own rather than only as a diagnostic when the
    count is off. Attacking the count arm alone found the hole: delete one page
    and add one stray page and the arithmetic balances while a page the map
    advertises is gone.

    The count arm is the one a later gate can legitimately move: it assumes the
    tree holds exactly one index per module plus one top index. A gate that adds
    an index tier has to update the accounting -- deliberately, not silently,
    because the constant is named here and nowhere else.

    - it covers EVERY page in the tree, while `inbound_attribution` only covers
      pages whose title names a known entity. A page that lost its title, or
      that the store no longer knows about, is invisible to the store check and
      visible here.
    - it survives the store: a later gate that changes the schema breaks the

    Split into PRODUCTION and TEST buckets (gate g5): a page carrying an
    inbound line must carry EXACTLY TWO, one per bucket, each named exactly
    once. The arithmetic within each bucket is the rule the single line always
    satisfied: you cannot name a module twice, you cannot name more modules
    than you counted, the counted modules you do not name must be EXACTLY the
    one the line accounts for with `+ N in this module` -- one when it does,
    none when it does not -- you cannot attribute more sites to your own

    named, you cannot draw N sites from more than N modules, and zero sites
    and zero modules must arrive together.

    The two inbound lines must be followed by `REFS_LEGEND` (what the count
    counted) then `SPLIT_LEGEND` (what the split was based on) -- a number a
    reader cannot interpret is the defect `g2` closed, and a split whose basis
    is not stated is the defect `g5` exists to close the same way.

    An entity's own module classification (page-local: derived from the
    TITLE's dotted name, the same string this function already reads, so no
    store lookup is needed) governs `TEST_NOTE`: it must be present when the
    page's own module is a test module, and absent otherwise -- a test-defined
    entity's near-universal none/none must not read as a bare, alarming line,
    and a production entity must not be told it is a test.

def entity_symbol_join(m):
    """A page's title must be what the SOURCE says is defined at its position.

    RE-BASED AT `g3`, and the reason is worth stating. This check used to
    compare two independent AST passes -- the extractor's symbol against a
    second pass's qualified key -- welded on (file, line). `g3` deleted that
    second pass. Left standing on one derivation the check would have compared
    the store symbol against a page title RENDERED FROM THAT SAME SYMBOL: a
    tautology that cannot fail, which is the exact defect this run exists to
    stamp out and would have arrived through a legitimate refactor.

    So the second derivation is `SourceScan`, here in the checks, deriving every
    definition's qualified name from the source text with no code path in common
    with `extract.py`. The comparison is now a stronger one than the old pair
    made: it is the map against the SOURCE, not one pass against another.

    Two arms, and they fail in opposite directions.

    - NAMING: for every entity page, the definition the source finds at the
      store's recorded position must have the page's own title as its qualified
      name. This catches a symbol that drops its enclosing chain, a symbol
      recorded at the wrong line, and a page titled after something that is not
      there at all.
    - COVERAGE: every definition the source scan finds must have a page. This is
      the arm that catches LOSS -- `tc34`, where the deleted second pass never
      descended into a `with` block, so definitions inside one had no page and
      nothing in the map said they were missing.

    What it does NOT prove: that the page's CONTENT is right. A page can be
    titled correctly and carry another entity's callers; that is
    `inbound_attribution`'s job."""

    """A page's title must agree with the directory it was written into.

    `tc31`: nothing above ties a page's LOCATION to its CONTENT. Every check
    in this module reads a page by its TITLE -- `page_accounting` proves every
    title the store expects exists SOMEWHERE in the tree; `entity_symbol_join`
    and `inbound_attribution` both start from `m.entity_pages`, which finds a
    page by title too. None of them ask WHERE a page sits. Swap two pages'
    file contents, or move one into a sibling module's directory, and every
    title the store expects is still present somewhere -- COVERAGE holds,
    COUNT holds, naming and inbound arithmetic both hold, because all four are
    blind to location. `g4` adds a routing tier ON TOP of that same layout, so
    this is where the gap closes rather than doubling.

    The expected location comes out of each page's OWN title, never out of
    `page_file` or any renderer index -- a check that asks the code under test
    where its own output should live can only ever agree with it. A module
    page's title is the module's own dotted name and must sit at
    `<title>/INDEX.md`; an entity page's title is `<module>:<qualified name>`
    and must sit inside `<module>/`, whatever its filename -- the filename
    itself is `page_file`'s own case-fold disambiguation, which this check
    does not re-derive, so it stays independent of that scheme too.

    What it does NOT prove: that a MISNAMED page (right directory, wrong
    filename for its title) is caught -- only that the DIRECTORY is right.
    `no-empty-pages` and `page-accounting` together already constrain the
