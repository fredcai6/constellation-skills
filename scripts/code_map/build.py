"""scripts/code_map/build.py -- the plain-importable build() seam.

`cli.py`'s `_build(args)` delegates here so there is exactly one build path,
not two that can drift: the CLI `build` subcommand and any library caller
(e.g. `precommit.py`'s index-snapshot mechanism) both run through this same
function.

Stage modules are imported inside the function rather than at module scope,
mirroring `cli.py`'s own docstring rationale: importing a caller of this
module must not pay for the extractor.
