"""Full-repo derived map -- one page per entity, agent-lean.

The module list and the entity tree are both DERIVED from the statement store
and from nothing else. The top INDEX groups modules by top-level package so it
stays a routing surface as the module count grows.

Importing this module has no side effects: the prototype loaded its stores at
import time, which made the module unimportable without a built store and
impossible to run twice against different roots. `load_stores()` now owns that.

ONE STORE (gate g3). There used to be a second AST pass whose entity keys the
renderer joined to the store's symbols on (file, line), because the statement
vocabulary could not say what a definition WAS. It can now, so the pass and the
join are both gone: a page is keyed by the store symbol itself.

That removal also closed `tc34`. The second pass descended `node.body` only, so
a definition inside a `with`, `if`, `try` or `for` block was not an entity at
all -- no page, no caller list, and no report saying it was missing. The
statement extractor is an `ast.NodeVisitor` and always reached those
definitions, so they get pages now.

D1 is FIXED (gate g3): the store declares its line base in every
`extraction-window` statement, and `source_line` reads that declaration instead
of compensating with an unexplained `+1`.
D2 is FIXED (gate g2): `extract.py` names every definition as its enclosing
scope's symbol plus its own name.
